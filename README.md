✨ I'm a web developer passionate about making programming knowledge accessible to all and improving my skillset day by day.

When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to catch up on a list of SNES games that I never got to play as a kid. 


   
- 🔭 I’m currently working on The Odin Project
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development
- 📫 How to reach me: jeffreyally@gmail.com
